I recently graduated from the Advanced Program in Computer Science at the University of Science, Ho Chi Minh City, one of the top undergraduate programs in Vietnam. You can explore my [Publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j4ck-L4AAAAJ)

How can we enhance AI safety in practice? This question drives my research into the training dynamics of gradient-based methods. Training deep neural networks currently relies on simple gradient-based updates in the hope of finding good minima. But what if these methods fail and we realize that SGD is not the “master key”? In challenging scenarios such as label noise or out-of-distribution datasets, gradient-based methods can overfit noisy labels or introduce class biases. Should we still rely on gradient information in these cases? In previous work, I explored optimization techniques to enhance model generalization by delving into these training dynamics. By understanding how models generalize effectively, I aim to contribute to AI safety across diverse applications.

My research focuses on deep learning, particularly on improving the efficiency of training deep neural networks and enhancing their generalization capabilities. Currently, my work includes (but is not limited to):
1. **Model Robustness**: developing methods to improve neural networks' performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, noisy label datasets, ...
2. **Model Efficiency**: developing techniques to accelerate the training of neural networks.

I am seeking a PhD position starting in 2025. Please contact me through email if you are interested in my research!
