I recently graduated from the Advanced Program in Computer Science at the University of Science, Ho Chi Minh City, one of the top undergraduate programs in Vietnam. You can explore my [Publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j4ck-L4AAAAJ)

As AI systems become increasingly integral to our world, ensuring their safety and reliability has become a critical challenge. My current research focuses on **improving the safety and reliability of neural networks**. Current deep neural network training relies on **gradient-based methods**, which, despite their effectiveness, can fail in challenging scenarios such as noisy labels, out-of-distribution, or imbalanced class datasets. In these situations, these methods often overfit to noise or introduce biases, reducing model reliability. Motivated by these challenges, I focus on understanding and improving **training dynamics** to enhance **model generalization** in difficult settings. As a first step, I analyzed the behavior of perturbed gradients in Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) under noisy label conditions. This work aims to slow down the fitting of noisy labels, improving generalization and contributing to safer and more robust AI systems. Currently, my work includes (but is not limited to):
1. **Understanding Training Dynamics**: identifying interesting phenomena that occur during training and establishing theories about them.
2. **Generalization and Robustness**: establishing both the theoretical and practical aspects of optimization to enhance generalization on out-of-distribution datasets, noisy labels, and imbalanced class datasets.
3. **LLMs and Diffusion models**: developing both theoretical and practical methods to enhance the performance of real-world applications.

I am seeking a PhD position starting in 2025. Please contact me through email if you are interested in my research!
