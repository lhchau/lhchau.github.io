I recently graduated from the Advanced Program in Computer Science at the University of Science, Ho Chi Minh City, one of the top 10 undergraduate programs in Vietnam. You can explore my [Publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j4ck-L4AAAAJ)

My research focuses on deep learning, particularly on improving the efficiency of training deep neural networks and enhancing their generalization capabilities. In previous work, I studied optimization behaviors, analyzing how optimizers like SGD and SAM differ in performance and how these differences impact efficiency and generalization. This research was conducted through empirical studies on small-scale datasets. Currently, my work includes, but is not limited to:
1. Exploring optimization methods in out-of-distribution (OOD) or noisy label tasks to improve robustness.
2. Exploring the behavior of optimization in large language models to enhance both training efficiency and generalization.

I am seeking a PhD position starting in 2025. Please contact me through email if you are interested in my research!
